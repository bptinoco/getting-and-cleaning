The `run_analysis.R` file is a script that uses data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and cleans it, resulting in a data set grouped by individual subject and activity done by that subject.

The steps in the analysis were as follows:

1. Merging all the data sets together
2. Extract all variables that include the mean or standard deviation
3. Label the activities in the data set
4. Name all the variables
5. Create the final data set by averaging the variables in groups

All the variables included in the final `final.txt`data set are either the average of an average or the average of a standard deviation.
