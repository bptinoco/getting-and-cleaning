The `run_analysis.R` file is a script that uses data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and cleans it, resulting in a data set grouped by individual subject and activity done by that subject. 

All the variables included in the final `final.txt`data set are either the average of an average or the average of a standard deviation.
